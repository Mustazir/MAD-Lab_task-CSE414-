# 💰 Dart Bank Account System

This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Dart, including **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism** through a simple bank account management system.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Create regular and savings bank accounts
- Deposit and withdraw funds with validation
- Apply interest to savings accounts
- Encapsulated private data with getter methods
- Inheritance and method overriding
- Clean terminal output using `toString()`

## 🛠 OOP Concepts Used

| Concept         | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Encapsulation  | Private fields (`_balance`, `_accountNumber`, etc.) with public getters     |
| Inheritance    | `SavingsAccount` extends `BankAccount`                                      |
| Polymorphism   | `toString()` is overridden, and `applyInterest()` is called dynamically     |
